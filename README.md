# üè• Medora AI - Smart Medical Appointment System

## Why Do We Need Medora AI?

Modern healthcare and service industries face significant challenges in managing appointments efficiently. Traditional booking systems are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors or double-bookings. Patients and clients expect seamless, real-time interactions‚Äîpreferably through natural language and voice‚Äîwhile providers need intelligent scheduling that adapts to their availability and priorities.

**Medora AI** addresses these needs by providing:
- **Frictionless, voice-first appointment booking** for patients and clients.
- **Intelligent, multi-agent orchestration** that optimizes scheduling, resolves conflicts, and adapts to urgency.
- **Automated notifications and reminders** to reduce no-shows and improve communication.
- **A scalable, extensible platform** ready for future AI advancements.

## üåü What Can Medora AI Do Right Now?

- **Conversational Booking:** Users can book, cancel, or check appointments using natural language‚Äîvia chat or voice.
- **Voice Interaction:** Speak to the system and hear responses back, making the experience accessible and hands-free. (Now powered by `streamlit-audiorec` for reliable browser-based recording.)
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence:** Three specialized AI agents (User Bot, Doctor Bot, Scheduler Bot) collaborate to understand user intent, recommend doctors, and manage scheduling.
- **Hybrid LLM/Intent Architecture:** Routine actions (like booking/canceling) are handled by the orchestrator for reliability; all other queries are answered directly by a powerful LLM (default: `llama3-8b-8192` on Groq).
- **Smart Scheduling:** The system checks doctor/provider availability, validates time slots, and prevents double-booking.
- **Conflict Resolution:** If a requested slot is unavailable, the system suggests alternatives in real time.
- **Priority Handling:** Urgent and emergency requests are prioritized using a Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Email Notifications:** Users receive booking confirmations, cancellations, and reminders automatically.
- **Dashboard & Manual Controls:** Staff can view, add, or cancel appointments directly from the dashboard.
- **Doctor Directory:** Users can browse available doctors, their specialties, and schedules.

## üöÄ Real-World Problems Solved

- **Manual Scheduling Hassles:** Eliminates the need for phone calls or manual entry by enabling conversational, automated booking.
- **Double-Booking & Conflicts:** Prevents scheduling errors by checking provider availability and resolving conflicts dynamically.
- **Missed Appointments:** Reduces no-shows with automated reminders and confirmations.
- **Accessibility:** Makes appointment management easier for users with disabilities or those who prefer voice interaction.
- **Urgency Management:** Ensures that urgent and emergency cases are prioritized appropriately.
- **Scalability:** Supports multiple providers and can be extended to other industries (consultants, salons, etc.).
- **Staff Efficiency:** Frees up administrative staff from repetitive scheduling tasks.

## üîÆ Future: Integrating the Agent Development Kit (ADK)

While Medora AI already leverages a robust multi-agent system, integrating an **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** in the future will unlock even greater capabilities:

- **Continuous Learning:** Agents can adapt to user preferences, learn from historical booking patterns, and personalize recommendations.
- **Custom Agent Creation:** Easily add new agents for specialized tasks (e.g., insurance verification, follow-up scheduling).
- **Plug-and-Play Upgrades:** Swap or upgrade agent logic without rewriting the core system.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Use ADK to analyze appointment trends, provider utilization, and user satisfaction.
- **Cross-Domain Expansion:** Extend the system to other domains (legal, education, wellness) by developing new agent modules.

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

### Voice Input Issues
- Make sure your browser has microphone access enabled.
- If you see "Voice processing failed", try speaking clearly and for at least 2 seconds.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection (Google Speech Recognition API is used).
- If you see a detailed error, check the stack trace for audio format or permission issues.

### LLM/AI Issues
- If you see errors like `model_not_found` or 404, update your `.env` or `settings.yaml` to use a supported model (e.g., `llama3-8b-8192`).
- Make sure your `GROQ_API_KEY` is correct and you have access to the selected model.
- Restart the app after changing model settings.
